# WHAT THIS PIPELINE DOES *NOT* DO: publish the npm package. That is a release action on a
# tag, not a docs push. It DOES run the package's own test suite, because unlike karhu (whose
# GitHub Actions matrix runs the library tests on every push) otso has no other gate — and a
# reference describing behaviour the tests no longer support is exactly the failure this site
# exists to prevent.

# Runs on Ruxa via `git push ruxa main` (post-receive) or by hand from the checkout.
